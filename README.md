## Hi there 👋, my name is Adilson

### 👨‍💻 About me
I'm a backend developer experienced with developing APIs using Node.js and Java Spring Boot. I'm also experienced with chatbots, I really like the problems them can solve when used for the right application and advocate against creating one just for the sake of having one, the main use case I worked on was chatbots for customer support.

- Currently working on...
  - Learning some frontend to work as a fullstack developer
  - A portfolio, hopefully it will be up and running soon. 🤞
